## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues Discovered

### Issue #1: Infinite Loop After Question Addition

**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** BLOCKING

**Description:**
After successfully adding a manual question, React enters an infinite loop causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" warnings:

```
Warning: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component
calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a
dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render.
```

**Evidence:**

- 150+ consecutive console error messages
- Page becomes unresponsive
- Cannot proceed with test workflow (flag as finished, run verification)

**Impact:**

- Cannot complete E2E testing beyond question creation
- Cannot verify the full benchmark workflow
- Production users would experience browser crash/hang

**Likely Cause:**
Based on the error pattern and the fact that it occurs immediately after `addNewQuestion`, this is probably caused by:

1. A `useEffect` hook in `App.tsx` or a related component that updates state
2. The state update triggers a re-render
3. The `useEffect` runs again and updates state again
4. Creates infinite loop

**Files to Investigate:**

- `src/App.tsx` (Template Curator tab section)
- `src/stores/useQuestionStore.ts` (especially near line 305-370 where `addNewQuestion` is implemented)
- Any `useEffect` hooks that depend on `questionData`, `checkpoint`, or `selectedQuestionId`

**Suggested Fix:**
Review all `useEffect` hooks in the Template Curator section and ensure:

1. Proper dependency arrays are specified
2. State updates inside `useEffect` have proper guards/conditions
3. Consider using `useCallback` or `useMemo` to stabilize dependencies

## üìä Test Coverage Summary

### Completed Steps

1. ‚úÖ Navigate to Template Curator
2. ‚úÖ Open Create New Benchmark modal
3. ‚úÖ Fill in all metadata fields
4. ‚úÖ Submit benchmark creation form
5. ‚úÖ Handle confirmation dialog
6. ‚úÖ Verify benchmark was created
7. ‚úÖ Open Add Question modal
8. ‚úÖ Fill in question details
9. ‚úÖ Submit question form
10. ‚úÖ Verify question was added to store

### Blocked Steps (Due to Infinite Loop)

11. ‚ùå Flag question as finished
12. ‚ùå Navigate to Benchmark tab
13. ‚ùå Select question for verification
14. ‚ùå Run verification
15. ‚ùå View verification results
16. ‚ùå Download checkpoint

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Priority

1. **Fix the infinite loop bug** - This is blocking all further testing
2. **Add error boundary** - To prevent the entire app from becoming unresponsive
3. **Add logging** - To help identify which `useEffect` is causing the loop

### Once Fixed

1. Complete the E2E test for the full workflow
2. Test with multiple questions
3. Test the verification process
4. Test checkpoint download/upload
5. Test search functionality

### Recommended E2E Test Structure

```typescript
test('should create benchmark and add question', async ({ page }) => {
  // This test should be split into two:
  // Test 1: Benchmark creation (working)
  // - Create benchmark
  // - Verify metadata display
  // Test 2: Question addition (needs bug fix first)
  // - Add question
  // - Wait for page to stabilize (no infinite loop)
  // - Flag as finished
  // - Run verification
});
```

## üì∏ Screenshots Captured

1. `01-home-page.png` - Initial app state
2. `02-template-curator-empty.png` - Empty Template Curator
3. `03-create-benchmark-modal.png` - Create New Benchmark modal
4. `04-benchmark-created.png` - After benchmark creation
5. `05-add-question-modal.png` - Add Question modal
6. `06-question-added-with-template.png` - After question added (with errors)

## üîç Additional Observations

### Positive

- Modal improvements (Portal, backdrop, sizing) are working perfectly
- Template generation fix (BaseAnswer vs BaseModel) is working
- All form validations are working as expected
- UI is responsive and user-friendly

### Areas for Improvement

- Need better error handling when infinite loops occur
- Consider adding a "loading" state during question addition
- Could add debouncing to prevent rapid state updates
- Should add integration tests for the store actions

## ‚úÖ Conclusions

The benchmark creation workflow UI is **functionally complete** but has a **critical runtime bug** that prevents full workflow testing. The bug is highly reproducible and needs to be fixed before the feature can be considered production-ready.

**Recommendation:** Fix the infinite loop issue before writing comprehensive E2E tests. The current E2E test file (`benchmark-creation-workflow.spec.ts`) can be used as a starting point but will timeout due to this bug.
