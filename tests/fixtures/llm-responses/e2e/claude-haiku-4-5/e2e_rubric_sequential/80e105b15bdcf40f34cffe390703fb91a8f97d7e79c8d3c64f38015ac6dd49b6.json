Your response MUST conform to this schema.\nReturn valid JSON: {\"score\": N} where N is an integer from 1 to 5\nKeep your response concise - the JSON is the primary output.\n\n**SCORING GUIDELINES:**\n- 1 = Poor - Does not meet criteria at all\n- 3 = Average - Partially meets criteria\n- 5 = Excellent - Fully meets or exceeds criteria\n\nWhen uncertain about borderline cases, choose conservatively based on the trait's nature:\n- For traits where higher is better (e.g., \"quality\"), lean toward lower scores\n- For traits where lower is better (e.g., \"error severity\"), lean toward higher scores\n- When completely uncertain, default to the middle value (3)\n\n**PARSING NOTES:**\n- Scores outside [1, 5] are automatically clamped to the nearest boundary\n- Use integers only (no decimals)\n- Avoid wrapping in markdown code blocks",
