@karenina-gui/integration-tests-prd.json

1. Find the highest-priority feature to work on and work only on that feature.
   This should be the one YOU decide has the highest priority - not necessarily the first one (once you select the task you find context by searching in )
2. Check that the types and tests with npm run check.
3. Update the PRD with the work that was done.
4. Append your progress to the progress.txt file.
   Use this to leave a note for the next person working in the codebase.
5. Make a git commit of that feature.

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE FEATURE.
