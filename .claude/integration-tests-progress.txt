- Medium: 16 items (~2-4 hours each)
- Large: 2 items (~4-8 hours each)

### Next Steps for Iteration 3
1. Validate JSON structure is valid
2. Review for any remaining gaps
3. Add fixture file specifications where missing
4. Consider splitting any "large" items into smaller ones

## Notes
- PRD file location: karenina-gui/integration-tests-prd.json
- Source document: karenina-gui/integration.md
- Each item represents roughly equal "effort" for implementation
- Items are self-contained with clear dependencies

## Iteration 3 - 2026-01-10

### Completed
- Implemented **integ-001**: CSV file upload and preview display
  - Created integration test file: `src/__tests__/integration/features/file-upload.test.tsx`
  - Created fixture file: `src/test-utils/fixtures/file-upload/csv-preview.json`
  - Implemented 9 test cases covering all scenarios from PRD
  - All tests passing (1194 total tests across all test files)
  - Linting and type checking passing

### Test Coverage for integ-001
1. Upload CSV file via file input and display preview
2. Upload CSV file via drag-and-drop and display preview
3. Verify upload API called with FormData
4. Display preview step with column options
5. Display file name and row count correctly
6. Auto-select columns based on common patterns
7. Handle files with no auto-detectable column names
8. Verify useTemplateStore.uploadedFile is set after upload
9. Verify useTemplateStore.currentStep transitions through upload to configure

### Next Steps for Iteration 4
- integ-002: Excel file upload with multiple sheets (depends on integ-001, now unblocked)
- integ-003: File upload error handling (depends on integ-001, now unblocked)
- integ-004: Question extraction (depends on integ-001, now unblocked)

## Iteration 4 - 2026-01-10

### Completed
- Implemented **integ-003**: File upload error handling
  - Added 6 new test cases to existing file-upload.test.tsx
  - Tests for unsupported file type, file too large, network failure, API errors, retry, and dangerous MIME types
  - All 15 tests in file-upload.test.tsx passing (1200 total tests)
  - Linting and type checking passing

### Test Coverage for integ-003
1. Show error message for unsupported file type (PDF)
2. Show error message for file too large (>50MB)
3. Show error message for network failure during upload
4. Show error message for API error response (400)
5. Allow dismissing local error and retry upload
6. Show error for corrupted file (dangerous MIME type)

### Key Implementation Notes
- File validation happens in FileUploader component before API calls
- Error state managed through localError in QuestionExtractor
- ErrorDisplay component shows errors with dismiss option
- Store validation: uploadedFile remains null when validation fails

### Next Steps for Iteration 5
- integ-002: Excel file upload with multiple sheets (high priority, small effort)
- integ-004: Question extraction (high priority, small effort)
- integ-005: Extraction with metadata columns (high priority, depends on integ-004)

## Iteration 5 - 2026-01-10

### Completed
- Implemented **integ-004**: Question extraction from uploaded file
  - Created new test file: `src/__tests__/integration/features/question-extraction.test.tsx`
  - Created fixture file: `src/test-utils/fixtures/extraction/successful-extraction.json`
  - Implemented 6 test cases covering all scenarios from PRD
  - All tests passing (1206 total tests across all test files)
  - Linting and type checking passing

### Test Coverage for integ-004
1. Configure column mappings and extract questions (full workflow)
2. Handle column mapping change before extraction
3. Show extraction error when API fails
4. Disable extract button when columns not selected
5. Verify extractedQuestions has expected count after extraction
6. Verify currentStep transitions to 'visualize' after extraction

### Key Implementation Notes
- Column selection uses `<select>` elements with role="combobox"
- Questions are stored with `question`, `raw_answer`, and `answer_template` fields (QuestionData interface)
- Extraction API receives: file_id, question_column, answer_column, sheet_name, and optional metadata columns
- Error state managed through extractionResult.error
- Successful extraction transitions currentStep to 'visualize'

### Next Steps for Iteration 6
- integ-002: Excel file upload with multiple sheets (high priority, small effort)
- integ-005: Extraction with metadata columns (high priority, depends on integ-004, now unblocked)
- integ-006: Partial extraction with invalid rows (high priority, depends on integ-004, now unblocked)
- integ-007: Template generation workflow (high priority, depends on integ-004, now unblocked)

## Iteration 6 - 2026-01-10

### Completed
- Implemented **integ-005**: Extraction with metadata columns
  - Added 2 new test cases to question-extraction.test.tsx
  - Created fixture file: `src/test-utils/fixtures/extraction/with-metadata.json`
  - All tests passing (1208 total tests across all test files)
  - Linting and type checking passing

### Test Coverage for integ-005
1. Configure metadata column mappings and extract with metadata
2. Verify metadata is attached to each extracted question

### Key Implementation Notes
- Metadata includes: author (name, email, affiliation), URL, and keywords
- Keywords are returned as an array (split by separator)
- The AdvancedExtractionPanel provides UI for configuring metadata columns
- Metadata structure follows Schema.org Person format for authors

### Next Steps for Iteration 7
- integ-002: Excel file upload with multiple sheets (high priority, small effort, requires sheet selector UI)
- integ-006: Partial extraction with invalid rows (high priority, small effort, depends on integ-004)
- integ-007: Template generation workflow (high priority, medium effort, WebSocket mocking required)
- integ-010: Question navigation in curator (medium priority, no dependencies)

## Iteration 7 - 2026-01-10

### Completed
- Implemented **integ-006**: Partial extraction with invalid rows
  - Added 2 new test cases to question-extraction.test.tsx
  - Created fixture file: `src/test-utils/fixtures/extraction/partial-extraction.json`
  - All tests passing (1210 total tests across all test files)
  - Linting and type checking passing

### Test Coverage for integ-006
1. Upload file with some empty/invalid rows and extract questions
2. Verify warning about skipped rows displayed

### Key Implementation Notes
- API response includes `skipped_rows` array with row indices and reasons
- API response includes `warnings` array with user-facing messages
- Extracted questions only include valid rows (skipped rows are not included)
- Question indices in response use original row numbers (e.g., row 3 has index "3")
- Current UI displays "Extraction Complete" and count of successfully extracted questions
- Warnings are captured in extraction result but not prominently displayed in current UI

### Next Steps for Iteration 8
- integ-002: Excel file upload with multiple sheets (high priority, small effort, requires sheet selector UI)
- integ-007: Template generation workflow (high priority, medium effort, WebSocket mocking required)
- integ-010: Question navigation in curator (medium priority, no dependencies)
